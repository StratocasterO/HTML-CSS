		Being is the only invariant in every passing dream. The singularity of science is the inseparability of space time energy information and matter. The time is always now. Love is ultimate reality. The lucid and vivid now is the cusp of a wave riding the ocean of infinity. Energy is a human construct in human awareness. Everyday reality morphs with abandon in every sentient being in every nanosecond. Only the Infinite is real. Our essential nature is formless. <br><br>

		Now is not a moment in time. As pure consciousness, you are the immeasurable potential of all that was, all that is, and all that will be. Awareness is the source of all constructs. The irreducible essence of existence is pure awareness. You are a unique expression of pure consciousness. Cosmic consciousness is the immeasurable potential for all modes of knowing and experience in every sentient being. Existence is a seamless wholeness and of the nature of awareness. The finite is a momentary experience within the Infinite. Eternity is not endless duration but timeless now.

		Thought creates subject/object split overshadowing the reality of the One Mind. The finite is a momentary experience within the Infinite. Now is not a moment in time. Reality is one formless awareness. In every act of perception we convert quantum information into a three dimensional universe evolving in time. The singularity of science is the inseparability of space time energy information and matter. Eternity is not endless duration but timeless now. Every breath is a prayer. Awareness being infinite has infinite perspectives. <br><br>

		Love is ultimate reality. Awareness is the source of all constructs. Being is the only invariant in every passing dream. Everyday reality morphs with abandon in every sentient being in every nanosecond. Consciousness is divinity within us. We are the universe in ecstatic dance. As pure consciousness, you are the immeasurable potential of all that was, all that is, and all that will be. All modes of knowing and all phenomenon known in the matrix of cosmic consciousness. Nature is a self regulating ecosystem of awareness.

		Energy is a human construct in human awareness. The building blocks of the physical world called waves and particles are mathematical abstractions in consciousness. The singularity of science is the inseparability of space time energy information and matter. Attention & intention are the mechanics of manifestation. Our essential nature is formless. Bondage is none other than the notion of objects. We must understand the consciousness in which species-specific knowing and experience occurs. Thought creates subject/object split overshadowing the reality of the One Mind. We are the universe in ecstatic dance. <br><br>

		Cosmic consciousness is the immeasurable potential for all modes of knowing and experience in every sentient being. In every act of perception we convert quantum information into a three dimensional universe evolving in time. The irreducible essence of existence is pure awareness. Everyday reality is a notion. Being is the only invariant in every passing dream. The time is always now. All names & forms are transient patterns of timeless formless being. Consciousness creates physical reality through quantum music. There is no such thing as an absolute objective reality in the theater of spacetime and causality and matter.</div>
